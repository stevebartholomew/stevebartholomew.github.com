  <div class="entry-content"><p>I worried that I was going to find the discussion between <a href="http://twitter.com/dhh">DHH</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/kentbeck">Kent Beck</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/martinfowler">Martin Fowler</a> annoying but I actually really enjoyed it. Well worth <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/ci2g23mk0lh9too9bgbp3rbut0k">watching</a>.</p>

<p>Kent &amp; Martin&#8217;s responses seemed quite surprising to DHH who appears to have had a very dogmatic experience of TDD. The daily use of the guys that were influential in the popularisation of the techniques were more pragmatic than many people will have imagined.</p>

<p>I look forward to the next discussion where I think we&#8217;ll get into the meat of TDD.</p>

<p>I wrote a number of headline points for your enjoyment!</p>

<h2>Kent Beck</h2>

<ul>
<li>If an idea is bad, find a cheap way to try it</li>
<li>Programmers have a right to feel confident about their code</li>
<li>TDD is one way to achieve confidence</li>
<li>Mixing techniques - some TDD, some not is totally fine - it&#8217;s powerful tool</li>
<li>TDD is often about trade offs</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t twist design to make it testable</li>
<li>Generally doesn&#8217;t mock anything

<ul>
<li>Mocking can couple you to implementation which too high a price</li>
<li>Repeatable feedback loop is far more important</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2> DHH</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dogma in TDD circles is big problem (i.e. you <em>must</em> TDD 100% to be a &#8216;professional&#8217;)</li>
<li>Mocking forces unnatural structure, supporting tests instead of code</li>
<li>&#8220;Easy to test == better design&#8221; is a fallacy</li>
<li>Understandability is often compromised</li>
</ul>


<h2>Martin Fowler</h2>

<ul>
<li>TDD does not imply isolation or mocking</li>
<li>Self-testing code is one of the most important things to deliver - TDD is one approach and it has other benefits</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Android woes</h2>

<p>Mostly fighting off Android issues with our audio player component. Cordova&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-media">Media plugin</a> is a little difficult to work with as it&#8217;s very much written to work with older iOS APIs. This seems to have influenced how the other platform integrations work.</p>

<p>There are very limited event callbacks as the audio plays so I have to keep track of playing using a timer:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">timer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">setInterval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bind</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">updatePlayerStatus</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I can&#8217;t rely on the timer for position data so I get it using <code>getCurrentPosition</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">updatePlayerStatus</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">player</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getCurrentPosition</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bind</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">position</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">// update UI</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Trouble is this sometimes leads to the UI being out of sync with the audio.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also not happy with my UI implementation as it uses a native web form slider. This was a quick implementation but it needs workarounds to get a &#8216;played&#8217; track - which can be a little flaky.</p>

<h2>Android joys</h2>

<p>On a more positive note, I&#8217;ve found the joy of <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging">remote debugging on Android</a>. I&#8217;m used to this on iOS of course but the Android tools are even better. Safari&#8217;s remote inspector constantly disappears and you don&#8217;t get any console logging that occurs prior to opening the inspector. Very impressed with Android here.</p>

<h2>Listening</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="http://www.imore.com/debug">Debug</a> before; they have great interviews with developers about their history &amp; work. This week they <a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-35-scotty-nsconference-and-remobjects">interviewed Scotty</a> of NSConference and iDeveloper fame.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A little slow this week while we debate largely non-technical issues with Apple. Doubling-down on Android is the order of the week.</p>

<hr />

<p>On a more positive front we had a very successful deploy of a huge improvement to the most important part of our service. It was a multi-app deploy and has so far gone off without a hitch. This is how it <em>should</em> be of course but you can never be 100% until it&#8217;s in the wild. As well as <a href="http://twitter.com/morgan_randy">Randy&#8217;s</a> awesome code we also did quite a bit of manual testing and a detailed code review.</p>

<h2>Listening</h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg">Megan Fox</a> discussed game dev on this week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.rubyrogues.com">Ruby Rouges</a> which was low on Ruby but and interesting insight into an industry so different to the web dev I&#8217;m used to.</p>

<p>I literally cried listening to <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfSaraSeager">Sara Seager</a> on <a href="http://storycollider.org/podcast/2014-04-30">Story collider</a>. The episode is funny, tragic but also beautifully inspiring - impressive for only 16 minutes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>This week</h2>

<p>The app store wait continues while we work on promo sites and continued Android fixes.</p>

<h2>Spending time with Android</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve spend the week using a Nexus 5 as my carry phone to get a feel for the subtle differences in the platform. It&#8217;s been a good learning exercise as I now have a better understanding of Android.</p>

<p>On the whole it&#8217;s what I expected: great service integration &amp; some interesting features but way lower quality of hardware and software. I&#8217;ve always thought the UI looked messy but it&#8217;s actually just a bad user experience in many places.</p>

<h3>Third-party apps</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m a heavy podcast user - I listen to multiple podcasts during the day. My week on Android was made worse but a complete lack of decent podcast clients. Every one of them was awful - confusing, overblown interfaces, even the &#8216;basic&#8217; features were impossible to use and understand. I tried many - both paid and free - from &#8216;the best of&#8217; lists and none of them made any sense.</p>

<h2>Xamerin</h2>

<p>Like many programmers my reaction to the lack of a decent podcast client was to think &#8216;hey - I could write my own!&#8217;. This lead me to the <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamerin Project</a>. I remember Xamerin &amp; Mono from the early 2000s when I was primarily working in .NET.</p>

<p>After working on a PhoneGap-based project it was interesting to see another approach to the problem of cross-device development. So far I&#8217;m impressed. The main idea is to write your core code in shared libraries then create platform-specific UI code that hooks up to it. The whole thing is then compiled down and run on a platform-specific runtime shipped with the app.</p>

<h2>DHH vs TDD</h2>

<p>I was a die-hard, London-school TDDer and boy did I talk about it. My approach has softened a lot recently. I broadly agree with DHH&#8217;s issue with being so prescriptive. Many things that we treat as process should actually be tools for getting the job done. Pair programming, TDD, Agile etc are all susceptible to &#8216;silver-bullet&#8217; syndrome.</p>

<p>It is however, important to remember that skepticism is about applying critical thinking - not just dismissing out of hand. The urge to argue against the doctrine can blind you to the good stuff. For example, you&#8217;re missing out if you&#8217;ve <em>never</em> used tests as a way to drive design. A lot of the time it just makes the feedback cycle quicker.</p>

<p>Ultimately we&#8217;re all just trying to write good code and get good results. I can&#8217;t say it better than Zed Shaw: <a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/">Programming, Motherfucker</a>.</p>

<h2>Listening</h2>

<p>The ongoing debates and issues surrounding sexism in tech have no doubt been on everyone&#8217;s minds recent. The <a href="http://www.imore.com/debug-34-sexism-tech">Debug podcast</a> had a great discussion with a panel of women in the tech industry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>This week</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re now in the &#8216;Waiting for Review&#8217; stage of every iOS release so most of the time has been spent tidying up, spiking new features and bug fixing in prep for our Android release.</p>

<h2>Listening to smart people</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago I had a debate about our evolving API with my good friend &amp; college <a href="http://twitter.com/timpeat">Tim</a>. He was pushing for a more &#8216;hypermedia-style&#8217; while I was more keen on &#8216;keeping things simple&#8217;.  I&#8217;ve always kept and ear to the ground on hypermedia but it felt too up in the air still.</p>

<p>My mind has been changed after listening to the &#8221;<a href="http://javascriptjabber.com/104-jsj-hypermedia-apis-with-steve-klabnik/">Hypermedia APIs</a>&#8221; epsiode of Javacript Jabber where <a href="http://twitter.com/steveklabnik">Steve Klabnik</a> goes in depth on the philosophy behind hypermedia and talks about <a href="http://jsonapi.org">jsonapi.org</a>.  With a specification building around it - and the benefits of convention and a richer data set - I really feel like it&#8217;s something we can get behind. I&#8217;m really glad we versioned our APIs sensibly!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also resolved to dig deeper before dismissing an idea. A throw away comment from Steve hit it home for me: &#8220;I was like, &#8216;That person&#8217;s smart. But they said something that sounds stupid. I should maybe think about why I feel that’s true and maybe go look into what their argument is.&#8217;&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Podcasts</h2>

<p>The past few Javascript Jabber episodes have really stood out for me. <a href="https://twitter.com/rockbot">Raquel Vélez</a> talking about <a href="http://javascriptjabber.com/103-jsj-robots-with-raquel-velez/">robotics and Javascript</a> was fantastic and really inspiring to get out and play with something other than pure code.</p>

<p>The Incomparable have rebooted their podcast <a href="http://www.theincomparable.com/teevee/">Teevee</a>. At there moment they&#8217;re talking about Game of Thrones.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>This week</h2>

<p>Super excited that the project I&#8217;m on a work is shipping next week!</p>

<p>Looking back I&#8217;m pretty impressed with what we’ve achieved so far.  We&#8217;ve used open source tech well but we’re still only a small team.  Over the coming weeks we&#8217;ll be shipping an app on both iOS and Android that hooks up to our existing backend systems - then the real work starts!</p>

<hr />

<p>We were lucky enough to not be vulnerable to heartbleed but I&#8217;ve really enjoyed digging into the bug.  There’s a great rundown of the specifics <a href="http://blog.existentialize.com/diagnosis-of-the-openssl-heartbleed-bug.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve always worked in memory managed languages, but my current C studying has just hit memory management. I was pleased to be able to keep up!</p>

<h2>Reading</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve finally picked up <a href="http://sicpebook.wordpress.com/">SICP</a>. Not too far in yet but it’s great to be digging deeper into compsci.</p>

<p>On my commute I’m still working through the &#8221;<a href="http://c.learncodethehardway.org/">Learn C the Hard Way</a>&#8221; which has been a lot of fun.  I have to confess that I’ve started copy/pasting the code but that is meaning I have more time for the ‘Extra Credit’ exercises.</p>

<p>My son is obsessed with Minecraft so I’ve also picked up the <a href="http://pragprog.com">pragprog</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/ahmine/learn-to-program-with-minecraft-plugins">book on creating plugins for the game</a>. It’s giving me a light introduction to Java and has been good to pair with a 5 year old.</p>

<h2>Listening</h2>

<p>Related to the Minecraft obsession, I’ve found the “Volume Alpha” by C418 really good for coding.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My wife has had the same website I built for her <a href="http://www.sevenveils.co.uk">dance business</a> in 2005. In that time we&#8217;ve had countless attempts at redeveloping it, normally starting with opening Photoshop, or setting up an account on the latest CMS service. These attempts all ended up half completed.</p>

<p>Running off the high of an event on Saturday night, we sat down on Sunday to prepare for the next show. Rather than the usual hacky updates, I decided to do improve things a little. Not a full rebuild, not perfect - but good enough.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Both iOS and Android have UI automation frameworks for driving the UI which is great for integration/acceptance testing for your app.  However, when you&#8217;re using a web/native hybrid framework like Cordova, this can get tricky.</p>

<p>If you come from the Ruby world, you may also be used to using Cucumber for integration testing. While the testing landscape for hybrid apps is a little rocky, a lot of smart people are working on some great tools to improve things. With some effort, you can have Cucumber-based integration spec suite up and running for your hybrid app with relative ease.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I built <code>SBGauge</code> as part of <a href="http://www.groovecoachapp.com">GrooveCoach</a> as a way to indicate which &#8216;level&#8217; the user was on. When you tapped &#8216;+&#8217; or &#8216;-&#8217; the gauge changed accordingly. As part of developing that app I was keen to open source anything I could.</p>

<p>Given the flexibility of this simple library, I thought it would make an interesting code walkthrough.</p>
