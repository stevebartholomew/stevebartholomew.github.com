I just pushed some code that fixed some fairly major issues I discussed in [Friday's Dev Diary](/blog/2014/06/27/dev-diary-27th-june-2014/). This amounted to about 4 hours work but it summed up to around 5 lines changed in production code.

It would have been easy to jump in and start panic hacking.  However, most of that 4 hours was spent manual testing, proving/debunking assumptions, reading documentation, experimenting etc.

I'm reminded that so much of programming, like any other craft, is about knowing the *right* lines to write - not how many.
