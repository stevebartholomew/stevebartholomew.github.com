## This week

Super excited that the project I'm on a work is shipping next week!

Looking back I'm pretty impressed with what we’ve achieved so far.  We've used open source tech well but we’re still only a small team.  Over the coming weeks we'll be shipping an app on both iOS and Android that hooks up to our existing backend systems - then the real work starts!

We were lucky enough to not be vulnerable to heartbleed but I've really enjoyed digging into the bug.  There’s a great rundown of the specifics [here](http://blog.existentialize.com/diagnosis-of-the-openssl-heartbleed-bug.html).

I’ve always worked in memory managed languages, but my current C studying has just hit memory management. I was pleased to be able to keep up!

## Reading

I've finally picked up [SICP](http://sicpebook.wordpress.com/). Not too far in yet but it’s great to be digging deeper into compsci.

On my commute I’m still working through the "[Learn C the Hard Way](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/)" which has been a lot of fun.  I have to confess that I’ve started copy/pasting the code but that is meaning I have more time for the ‘Extra Credit’ exercises.

My son is obsessed with Minecraft so I’ve also picked up the [pragprog](http://pragprog.com)'s [book on creating plugins for the game](http://pragprog.com/book/ahmine/learn-to-program-with-minecraft-plugins). It’s giving me a light introduction to Java and has been good to pair with a 5 year old.

## Listening

Related to the Minecraft obsession, I’ve found the “Volume Alpha” by C418 really good for coding.
