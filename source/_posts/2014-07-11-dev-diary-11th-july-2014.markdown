## Javascript Debugging Joy

I'm way late to the party on this - I just discovered the `debugger` command: [debugger - JavaScript | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger)

You get an analysis of the current callstack and can interact with the app within the scope `debugger` was called.

After spending quite a bit of time in Android studio where this is a common part of debugging workflow, this is a very welcome addition to my toolset.

## Android

Speaking of Android, I've been working my way through the [Big Nerd Ranch's Android book](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/android-programming) in preparation for starting development of a side project I'm kicking off in the next few weeks.

Despite the [positive parts of Xamerin](/blog/2014/04/25/dev-diary-25th-april-2014/), I've chosen to go native.  I'm keen to learn Java and the native Android platform so it's a much better choice for me right now.

So far I'm really enjoying Java. As [Sean Cassidy points out](http://blog.existentialize.com/better-java.html) Java might not be as bad as many would have you think.

## Old Code

I was amused and slight embarrassed to come across some old open source code of mine from 2002: [PHP MySQL Search Class](http://code.activestate.com/recipes/125901-php-mysql-search-class/).

My lack of competence with SQL shines through as I pull down the _entire table_ of data and do the filtering in PHP.

## Watching

Philip Roberts's talk on the [Javascript runtime](http://vimeo.com/96425312) is required viewing for anyone working with Javascript.
