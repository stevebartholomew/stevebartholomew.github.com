A little slow this week while we debate largely non-technical issues with Apple. Doubling-down on Android is the order of the week.

On a more positive front we had a very successful deploy of a huge improvement to the most important part of our service. It was a multi-app deploy and has so far gone off without a hitch. This is how it *should* be of course but you can never be 100% until it's in the wild. As well as [Randy's](http://twitter.com/randym) awesome code we also did quite a bit of manual testing and a detailed code review.

## Listening

[Megan Fox](https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg) discussed game dev on this week's [Ruby Rouges](http://www.rubyrogues.com) which was low on Ruby but and interesting insight into an industry so different to the web dev I'm used to.

I literally cried listening to [Sara Seager](https://twitter.com/ProfSaraSeager) on [Story collider](http://storycollider.org/podcast/2014-04-30). The episode is funny, tragic but also beautifully inspiring - impressive for only 16 minutes.
