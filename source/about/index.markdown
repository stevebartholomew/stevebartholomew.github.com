I'm Stephen Bartholomew and I'm a freelance Ruby developer based in Kent, England.

I've been working with Ruby & Rails full time since 2006 after years working heedy mix of PHP, Perl and .NET.

I experienced brief Ruby community fame when I created [StaticMatic](https://github.com/staticmatic/staticmatic) site generator but that's since been superceeded by a [number](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) of [impressive](http://octopress.org/) [alternatives](https://github.com/tdreyno/middleman).

If you're interested in hiring me I'm available for:

* Developer mentoring
* Code reviews 
* On or offsite contracts

[Drop me email](mailto:stephenbartholomew@gmail.com) or give me a call on 07729 60 60 79 if you'd like to chat.
