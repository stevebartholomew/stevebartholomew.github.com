4. Understand the life of your work

## Daily life
It's easy to focus on the immediate work at hand but everything you create has a life outside of the 6 months you're hired for.  Web apps will need to hosted, bugs will need to be fixed and features will need to added.

Rather than leaving this to chance, I suggest making it clear from the start that the everyone has a resposnbility in the future success of the project you're about to work on.

Before the project starts, discuss these things with with client:

* Hosting
* On-going maintenance
* Marketing / traffic
* Tweaks and features

Make it clear that you're not saying that have to hire you even - but they need to decide how they will handle these things.

For your part, you should have clear 'packages' for maintenance that are designed around the work you're prepared do.  If you're just looking to hand over to another team once the project is finished, that should be made clear.

## Carers

It should be part of your discipline to create software that can be understood and worked with in the future. Good software is communicative, clear & contains documentation.
