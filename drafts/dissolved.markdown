In February 2013, the company I co-founded in 2006 went into liquidation. The 9 months that preceeded this date were some of the toughest of my life. A 10 year+ friendship was lost. A huge amount of cash was spent on closing the company.

Today, the company where I learnt so much is showing up as 'DISSOLVED' on the companies house website.

The reasons behind the demise of Curve21 are long and complicated. A limited company may ulimately be a legal business entity but it's backed by humans with with real lives and real emotions.
